# WordPress-Plugins
A repo for custom wordpress plugin development

Plugins add extra functionality to your WordPress site over and above what comes with WordPress core. 
Everything from a booking calendar or animated slider to a full-featured learning management system or online marketplaceâ€”you can add them all to your site with plugins. 

I will be committing different custom plugin to this repo...stay tuned!
